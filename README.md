I think i'm getting there with the command line. I hope. Here I am, editing my first README.md file. I don't know how this will go but i'M Hoping it goes well. Adding a few more changes... This bootcamp is really challenging, but I love that i'm learning new things daily. i'm aso excited about the command line rn. So just by inputting nano filename I can edit the file from wherever? i'm not too sure about that though, I stand to be corrected. and sometthing funny just happened. I don't know how but my filename just changed and bacame a weird untracked file. I'll look into that!
